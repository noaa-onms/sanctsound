SanctSound is a nationally coordinated project co-led by NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the U.S. Navy.

SanctSound has relied on the efforts of over 75 people from all over the United States: vessel operators, engineers, researchers, data managers, web developers, graphic designers, program managers, financial and legal specialists and communication experts. During the global pandemic, this nationally-distributed team stayed coordinated virtually. Although not all team members are pictured here, we want to thank each and every member for their diverse contributions to this project.
