These institutional logos represent the large team of people who support the SanctSound monitoring projectâ€™s data collection, analysis, archive, and product distribution.

SanctSound has relied on the efforts of over 75 people from all over the United States: vessel operators, engineers, researchers, data managers, web developers, graphic designers, program managers, financial and legal specialists and communication experts. During the global pandemic, this nationally-distributed team stayed coordinated virtually. Although not all team members are pictured here, we want to thank each and every member for their diverse contributions to this project. Images clockwise: National project leads, Eastern Regional team, West Coast Regional team, Pacific Islands Regional team, Data Management and Portal team.
