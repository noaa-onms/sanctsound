Come up with a plan to implement the following menu update to to this [rmarkdown site]https://yihui.org/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site) here @.:

> We would like to request that these same updates be made to the SanctSound <https://sanctsound.ioos.us/> site as well. Andy Nguy, the developer from TetraTech who implemented the changes, has provided instructions<https://gist.github.com/nguyandy/3ad9bacba55996410f3cfecc597f64ee> to assist your web team with this process. Feel free to browse other sites that have already implemented these changes, such as Environmental Sensor Map<https://sensors.ioos.us/>, IOOS HF Radar<https://hfradar.ioos.us/>, MBON Data Portal<https://mbon.ioos.us/>, and others.

Investigate whether the JavaScript might conflict with the use of @libs/infographiq.js and if so, propose fixes.
